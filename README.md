# MLOps Zoomcamp - My Assignments

This repository contains my solutions and assignments for the MLOps Zoomcamp course by DataTalks.Club. Each module of the course is organized into separate directories with their respective assignments, code, and documentation.

## Course Overview

MLOps Zoomcamp is a comprehensive course on Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) covering the full lifecycle of ML projects, from data preparation to model deployment and monitoring.

## Repository Structure

- `01-intro/` 
  - Introduction to MLOps
  - NYC Yellow taxi trip duration prediction model
  - Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training
  - Metrics evaluation on training and validation datasets

## Completed Assignments

### Module 1: Introduction to MLOps

In this module, I created a linear regression model to predict the duration of taxi trips in NYC using Yellow Taxi Trip Records from January and February 2023. The assignment involved:

- Loading and exploring Yellow Taxi Trip data
- Computing trip durations and handling outliers
- Implementing one-hot encoding for categorical features
- Training a linear regression model
- Evaluating the model on both training and validation datasets

Tools & Libraries used:
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter notebooks

## Setup and Installation

This project uses Python 3.10+ and the following dependencies as specified in the pyproject.toml:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/Mac

# Install dependencies
pip install -e .
```

## Future Modules

I'll be adding more modules as I progress through the course:

- Module 2: Experiment tracking and model registry
- Module 3: Orchestration and ML pipelines
- Module 4: Model deployment
- Module 5: Model monitoring
- Module 6: Best practices
